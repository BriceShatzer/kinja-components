# Paragraph ![ready](status-images/ready.svg)

This BlockNode component renders a single Paragraph. Note that you rarely ever want to use this component in itself - rather you probably want to use [BlockNodeList](../block-node-list/README.md), since it takes care of combining the containers of nodes grouped together.

The documentation for the Paragraph block node can be found [here](../../../../postbody/blockNodes/Paragraph.md).
