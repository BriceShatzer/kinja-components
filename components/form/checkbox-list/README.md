# CheckboxList ![ready](status-images/ready.svg)

A `CheckboxList` is an array of checkboxes that are related to each other. It's functionally similar to a `Select`, but it allows users to choose multiple options and exposes all options by default. This makes it clearer and faster to use, but it also takes up more space. Use RadioGroups or CheckboxLists instead of Selects whenever it's possible.

For example, a CheckboxList is used to choose which blogs a Special Section appears in the navigation of.

Pass an array of CheckboxProps to a CheckboxList to use it.
