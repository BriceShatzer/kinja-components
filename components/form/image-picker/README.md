`ImagePicker` is an image upload component that is more visual than `ImageUpload`, with a preview of the uploaded image showing. Doesn't support url based upload, only a file browser, do to its visual nature.

Note that in Storybook the image uploader is mocked, and you will always get the same image, no matter what file you select.
