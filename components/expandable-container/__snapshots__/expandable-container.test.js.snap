	<p>Once upon a time, I was shooting a TV pilot. It was potentially a big moment for my career, but I’d tweaked my neck the week before. Not wanting to be all stiff, I went in to get some bodywork done, and it turns out that the bodyworker was a sadist who left me with visible bruises all over my neck. The morning of the shoot, I went to a department store to find some cover-up, and I could not for the life of me find anything that looked right. </p>
	<p>What’s especially wild about that is that, if we’re being honest here, I am a generic-ass white boy, and cosmetic companies have long designed
	<!-- -->the majority of their offerings
	<!-- -->for
	<!-- -->&nbsp;
	<!-- -->fair-skinned consumers
	<!-- -->. For people of color, finding a foundation that matches their skin perfectly can be
	<!-- -->more difficult. Companies like Fenty Beauty have certainly pushed the industry in the right direction, but there’s still a very long way to go, which is why I wanted to check out this new system from Lancôme.

You can go
	<!-- -->to one of over 20 stores around the U.S., get your skin scanned with a super-accurate colorimeter, and presto, precision pumps squirt different pigments and lotions into a bottle, and in five minutes, you have foundation that matches your skin exactly. I mean, it’s uncanny. You can even adjust the thickness and oiliness of it to match your complexion. At $88, it’s
	<!-- -->expensive for foundation, but for people who have struggled to find the right makeup, it might feel revolutionary. Check out the video above to see how the whole process works.</p>
