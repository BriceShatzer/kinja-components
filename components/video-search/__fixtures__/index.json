    "description": "Long ago, Jodi King tried to teach her teenage daughter Alanis how to drive on a first-generation Mazda Miata, thinking it’s always better to learn on a manual than an automatic. It didn’t go very well. But Alanis got better with time and eventually became a car journalist, and decided it was time to repay mom for all of that hard, frustrating work—with her first-ever track day.",
