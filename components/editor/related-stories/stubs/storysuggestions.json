If you spend most of your time on social media, texting, or browsing the web, the enhanced performance you’ll get from the A11 Bionic processor could be overkill.

Starting at $230, the 5.2-inch G5 Plus costs one-fifth of an iPhone X and it features a front-mounted fingerprint reader with nifty gesture control, an essentially stock version of Android, headphone jack and compatibility with any US.carrier. And if you’re an Amazon Prime member and don’t mind seeing ads on your lock screen, you can push that price even lower to $185 by getting a G5 Plus through Amazon’s Prime Exclusive phones program. Oh, and before I forget, if you want something like the G5 Plus but are looking for a slightly more upscale design and build, the Moto Z2 Play starts $408 and includes upgrades like mod support, an AMOLED screen and bigger 5.5-inch AMOLED display.",
