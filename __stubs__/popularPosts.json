It’s the second co-op brawl mode the <em>Overwatch </em>team has tried out, and it is killer.</p><p>After <em>Overwatch</em>’s co-op Halloween event, I had low hopes for this mode. “Junkenstein’s Revenge” was a PvE horde mode in which an onslaught of robots, plus some evil heroes, closed in on four players. Sure, it was supposed to be corny, but it also felt stagnant. I watched some videos where players barely moved the whole time. Players were even locked into a pre-fixed hero composition. It didn’t take advantage of what <em>Overwatch </em>could offer on the PvE front: involved maps, dynamic combat and an impetus to work together.</p><p>“Uprising” learned a lot from what I consider shortcomings of “Junkenstein’s Revenge.” It’s kinetic, one of <em>Overwatch</em>’s best qualities, taking place across the map rather than keeping players rooted to one spot. “Uprising” relives Tracer’s first mission, seven years before the events of <em>Overwatch</em>, when she and an elite strike team quelled a robot uprising and liberated her home. Tracer, Torbjorn, Reinhardt and Mercy navigate the sprawling, hybrid King’s Row map, retaking strategic points and defending and then moving a payload. Over an intercom, the heroes Ana and (pre-evil?) Reaper guide you. Throughout, a variety of robots close in from all sides. Some attack the payload. Others hide behind shields. The most fun to take down are Bastions and OR-14s, or proto-Orisas. </p><p class=\"has-video media-large video-embed align--bleed\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-chomp-id=\"cpGrY9i8TSA\" scrolling=\"no\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://cpGrY9i8TSA\" height=\"450\" id=\"youtube-cpGrY9i8TSA\" src=\"/ajax/inset/iframe?id=youtube-video-cpGrY9i8TSA&amp;start=0\" webkitAllowFullScreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" class=\"core-inset\" width=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p><p>When you die, other players can resurrect you by standing over your corpse. I died once or twice in “Normal” mode as Tracer. In “Hard” mode, which I recommend, strategy is crucial, or you’ll die a lot more. Players must call out where Bastions set up or risk getting mowed down. Mercy must alternate between damage boosting and healing. Reportedly, “Legendary Mode” is <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/64wigm/a_guide_for_the_uprising_in_legendary_mode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">near-impossible</a>. Each game lasts about 10 to 15 minutes. </p><p>“Uprising” shows off <em>Overwatch</em>’s PvE potential. Payload and control point maps are what the game’s all about, and on the hybrid King’s Row map, “Uprising” takes full advantage of its environment. The pre-selected team comprised of a DPS, defense, tank and healer is perfectly balanced. Each enemy calls for a different takedown strategy, especially at higher difficulties. When a mini-boss spawns in front of Tracer, Reinhardt had better tackle it. Players need to support each other—over the intercom, Ana says as much when she jokes that Reinhardt better not to charge in on his own. Because of the mode’s stress on teamwork, there’s nearly no downtime. You get into a state of flow, a feeling reminiscent of early first-person shooters’ campaign modes.</p><figure class=\"align--bleed \"><img data-format=\"Png\" data-chomp-id=\"la22o1blynecsl0rw14x\" height=\"459\" src=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--33EbHR0y--/la22o1blynecsl0rw14x.png\" lazyload=\"true\" data-asset-url=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--33EbHR0y--/la22o1blynecsl0rw14x.png\" width=\"800\"></img><figcaption >Overwatch</figcaption></figure><p>There’s also a version of “Uprising” where you can choose any four heroes, but it lacks the tension of the predetermined heroes.

But <em>Overwatch’s</em> Uprising event takes place seven years ago, when he was a bit more moody about the whole “brother tried to murder him,” thing, so somehow he’s even edgier. What’s most perplexing to me, and to the fandom, is the decision making process that led to knife-foot situation. For what purpose are these knives, Genji? Do they get in the way of everyday life?</p><p ><span class=\"twitter-embed\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" scrolling=\"no\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" height=\"159\" id=\"twitter-851869332808368133\" src=\"/ajax/inset/iframe?id=twitter-851869332808368133&amp;autosize=1\" webkitAllowFullScreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" class=\"core-inset\" width=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p><p ><span class=\"twitter-embed\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" scrolling=\"no\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" height=\"159\" id=\"twitter-851871348372721665\" src=\"/ajax/inset/iframe?id=twitter-851871348372721665&amp;autosize=1\" webkitAllowFullScreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" class=\"core-inset\" width=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p><p ><span class=\"twitter-embed\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" scrolling=\"no\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" height=\"159\" id=\"twitter-851869717782552576\" src=\"/ajax/inset/iframe?id=twitter-851869717782552576&amp;autosize=1\" webkitAllowFullScreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" class=\"core-inset\" width=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p><p ><span class=\"twitter-embed\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" scrolling=\"no\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" height=\"159\" id=\"twitter-852096446660792320\" src=\"/ajax/inset/iframe?id=twitter-852096446660792320&amp;autosize=1\" webkitAllowFullScreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" class=\"core-inset\" width=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p><p ><span class=\"\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" scrolling=\"no\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" height=\"800\" id=\"tumblr-post-159471309067-emutant\" src=\"/ajax/inset/iframe?id=tumblr-post-159471309067-emutant&amp;autosize=1\" webkitAllowFullScreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" class=\"core-inset\" width=\"640\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p><p ><span class=\"\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" scrolling=\"no\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" height=\"800\" id=\"tumblr-post-159461995788-xxpyrosomniacxx\" src=\"/ajax/inset/iframe?id=tumblr-post-159461995788-xxpyrosomniacxx&amp;autosize=1\" webkitAllowFullScreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" class=\"core-inset\" width=\"640\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p><p ><span class=\"\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" scrolling=\"no\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" height=\"800\" id=\"tumblr-post-159460044135-phereinnike\" src=\"/ajax/inset/iframe?id=tumblr-post-159460044135-phereinnike&amp;autosize=1\" webkitAllowFullScreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" class=\"core-inset\" width=\"640\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></span></p><p>Let it be known that this isn’t even the weirdest part of Genji’s robot feet.
