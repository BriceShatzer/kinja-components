It was very John Cook advice, and it led me very clearly to one person: Alex. What ensued was a completely batshit year of co-helming the Gizmodo ship, working together to wrangle some truly insane editorial staffers (hi, William), and publishing stories and blogs that will forever and ever be the favorite ones I’ve worked on (hi, Facebook). I didn’t get hit by a bus, but I did flame out of Gizmodo Media in somewhat dramatic fashion — and Alex, steadfast and strong leader that he is, kept things running through that little bit of hell. And then, from what I understand, some other hell that followed, and followed, and followed (hi, G/O media). Alex is among my closest friends and allies, taught me to use the word “froth” to denote editorial excellence, and always looked at my moles to tell me whether he thought I had skin cancer. I love the guy, I’m so grateful he took the job, and I’m so sorry for the years it probably shaved off his life. Alex, I hope you take a very very very long vacation.",

I called him back at the airport in Florida, as I waited to go home. Much to my surprise, he was calling me to see if I’d like to become a full-time writer for io9. It was a dream come true.
