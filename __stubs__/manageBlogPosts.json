It also appears to dim a bit when the planet passes behind the star. The color of the light also changes slightly, as the researchers see the added spectral lines, or spectra, from the planet.

The first staging of the monster-on-monster tussle promised by the title is indeed a good one, and includes the sight of an Alien spraying a Predator with the corrosive neon blood that’s spewing from its injured tail.

Everyone’s exhausted and beat up, there’s heat signature-obscuring fires raging all around, and the Berserker drops his space ax, allowing Royce to go full Lizzie Borden on his gigantic neck. There’s slo-mo, there’s dramatic music, and while we don’t get any snappy one-liners, there is an awful lot of neon-green blood. Our human heroes may still be stuck on a godforsaken planet, and they may be near death themselves, but for a tantalizingly brief moment...they get to bask in sweet success.",

When he runs out of ammo, he flings a golf ball at the invisible figure and tries to square off with a giant knife, but it’s obviously too late. The creature lurches at him (muttering “Want some candy,” ghoulishly echoing something he heard a child say in an earlier scene), and when Cantrell’s able to return to the car, she finds a pile of mutilated, grotesquely displayed bodies, including Lambert’s—as well as the waiting Predator, who lets her go after scanning her and realizing she’s pregnant. After all we’ve seen the Predator do, this act of mercy is actually pretty shocking, and it’s an affirmation that as brutal as the Predator is, he’s not just a rampaging monster. He’s got a code.

Even after he learns what he’s up against—thanks to Keyes and company, who’ve known all kinds of top-secret info about the Predator this whole time—Harrigan doesn’t back off. Instead, he goes the distance, pursuing the Predator not just through the halls of a crumbling apartment building, but all the way onto the spaceship, where we’re briefly distracted by a lingering shot of an Alien skull mounted in the trophy case before Harrigan manages to use one of the Predator’s own weapons to finally end things. By now, of course, the fight has become deeply personal, since the creature has specifically targeted people close to Harrigan to make him the angriest possible opponent—and not only does the cop emerge victorious, he earns the respect of the several other Predators who suddenly materialize to offer their version of “Good game, dude, good game.”",

I know small phones aren’t super popular, but it’s almost comical at how little effort companies put into making a modestly-sized devices with competent specs.",
