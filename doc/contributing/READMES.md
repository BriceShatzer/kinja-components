# Writing READMEs ![ready](status-images/ready.svg)

We write READMEs and Stories to document Kinja components. They are organised and displayed in Storybook.

READMEs describe use cases and properties of components, and provide usage examples. The main rule is that we rather read the readme than the source code of the component.

## Component Status

Mark the status of the component in the header of its README:

Status | Description
---- | -----------
![ready](status-images/ready.svg)      | The component is ready to be used on Kinja.
![under_review](status-images/under-review.svg)  | The componentâ€™s design, code, or usage is being re-examined.<br/> It's usable, but it'll soon be updated or deprecated.
![deprecated](status-images/deprecated.svg)   | Deprecated components are no longer supported, and will soon be deleted.

Additionally you can add one of these extra tags:

Tag | Description
---- | -----------
![new](status-images/new.svg)       | The component was recently added.
![updated](status-images/updated.svg)  | The component was recently updated.
